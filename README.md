## Intro üëã

This project leverages the IMemoryCache that's shipped as part of .NET/.NET Core SDKs to achieve in-memory caching specifically in monolithic environments. If you are looking for a distributed caching approach, then, my [other project](https://github.com/sahansera/DistributedCacheAspNetCoreRedis) would be more suitable for you.

I have also [blogged](https://sahansera.dev/in-memory-caching-aspcore-dotnet/) with a full explanation on how this is achieved.

## Architecture üèó
![](./Content/caching-2.jpg)

1. User A makes a request to our web service
2. In-memory cache doesn‚Äôt have a value in place, it enters in to lock state and makes a request to the Users Service
3. User B makes a request to our web service and waits till the lock is released
4. This way, we can reduce the number of calls being made to the external web service. returns the response to our web service and the value is cached
5. Lock is released, User A gets the response
6. User B enters the lock and the cache provides the value (as long it‚Äôs not expired)
7. User B gets the response

## Usage üöÄ

Open up in your favorte editor and do a `dotnet run` at the root of the project.
